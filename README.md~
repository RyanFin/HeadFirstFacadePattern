# HeadFirstFacadePattern

## Façade Pattern 

The façade pattern will treat complex systems as a subsystem consisting of multiple classes. The design pattern will make the architecture easier to use with a *single* reasonable interface. One method in the façade class can alter the values of multiple attributes belonging to multiple classes within the subsystem.

The intent of the façade pattern is to simplify an interface. Besides simplification, the façade pattern also decouples a client from a subsystem of components. An adapter, on the other hand, converts an interface into something different.
